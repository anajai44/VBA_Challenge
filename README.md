# VBA_Challenge
I struggled to make this code completely. I look at the Lecture's Recordings from Zoom to get a refresher. In addition, what I felt I needed more clarification than what was in the Recording, I reached out to the AskBCS Learning Assistants. They reference me to articles online. In addition, those articles lead me to Youtube tutorials and explantions of Excel VBA.

At a point, I had all the code almost completely right. However, I had the Total Stock Volume wrong.
While I was trying to fix the Total Stock Volume, I made a few changes to the code. I ended up with a code that I wasn't able to to get it back to the first one I had.
I tried my best, and completing the code to the best of my ability.
